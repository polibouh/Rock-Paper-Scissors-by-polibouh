## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to implement a classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors in Python, making it more engaging by using emojis to represent each **weapon** choice. This game allows a player to conduct a **battle** against the computer, bringing a fun and interactive experience to users.

We solve the problem by leveraging the random module for generating the computer's choice of weapon and the emoji module for adding visual appeal.

## The solution includes:

**Player Input Handling**: The player can choose their weapon by entering 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, or 's' for scissors.

**Computer Choice Generation**: The computer randomly selects its weapon from rock, paper, or scissors.

**Game Logic Implementation**: The game logic determines the winner based on the traditional rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

**Output**: The game announces the result of each round, indicating whether the player won, lost, or if the game was a draw. The results are displayed with colored text for better visibility.
